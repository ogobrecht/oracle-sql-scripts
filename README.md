# Oracle SQL Scripts

This is a list of scripts that I am using mainly for data modeling and deployments. They are MIT licensed - use it at you own risk. Inspect the scripts, understand what the code is doing (own it) and do not complain, when something goes wrong on your instance. Most of the scripts were created and tested under Oracle 12.2. If you have the feeling I should change something, then please open an [issue](https://github.com/ogobrecht/oracle-sql-scripts/issues/new/choose) and let us discuss it.

Happy scripting\
